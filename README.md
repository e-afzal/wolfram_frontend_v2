## Wolfram Realty

Wolfram Realty offers the users a slew of properties carefully categorized as per the brokerâ€™s target demographic.

- On the Front End, the User Interface has been created using <a href="https://nextjs.org">Next.js</a>. And, global state management is handled using <a href="https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs">Zustand</a>.

- Whereas on the Backend, the API was created using Node.js and Express. API calls to the Backend would enable the Frontend to display Property and Projects based data. This data is stored on <a href="https://www.mongodb.com">MongoDB Atlas</a>, a cloud based database.

- Finally, the frontend was deployed onto the <a href="https://vercel.com">Vercel cloud platform</a> whereas the backend was deployed to <a href="https://cyclic.sh">Cyclic</a>.
